    "# Clustering Colors to Compress Images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Suppose we have a $H \\times W$ image with $C = 3$ color channels (red, green and blue). Each color channel is represented by 8 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1: Assuming we don't do any compression, how many bits will you need to store the image on disk?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will use K-means clustering to lossily compress images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, observe that with $C$ color channels and 8 bits per channel, we can represent $2^{8C}$ colors. This is a massive number of colors (for $C = 3$, this is almost 17 million colors). Humans probably don't need a color palette this big.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us instead use a color palette with $K$ colors in it. We need $8CK$ bits to store the color palette. Then, for a $H \\times W \\times C$ image, we can turn each pixel into a single integer representing the index of the color in the palette that we should use. So, a pixel with a value $212$ would use the $212^{th}$ color in the palette.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2: Assuming we have already stored the color palette, how many bits do we need to store the compressed image?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3: Assume we have $N$ images of dimension $H \\times W \\times C$ that we compress with a $K$-color palette. What is the compression ratio (i.e. $\\frac{size_{compressed}}{size_{original}}$), as an algebraic expression, for the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4: For $N = 10,000$, $H = W = 512$, $C = 3$, and $K = 1000$, what is the compression ratio, as a number?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering\n",
    "Once we have chosen $K$, we need to figure out which colors to put in our palette. This can be done manually, which is time consuming and error prone. A better approach is to take a dataset of images and select the best colors with machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model the problem of picking a color palette as **clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning problem. The goal in clustering is to take a set of vectors (e.g. the $C$ dimensional colors) and pick a set of $K$ vectors that most accurately summarize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering algorithm that we will use in this assignment is called $K$-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4: Read Section 9.1 (K-means Clustering) in [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738/). If you don't have the book, read section 10.3.1 (K-Means Clustering) from the free book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)**.
