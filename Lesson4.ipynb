    "## Evaluating Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our scores and predictions, how do we evaluate the performance of our logistic\n",
    "regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge is that our Logistic Regression model does not actually predict 0-1 labels, it predicts\n",
    "a score between 0-1. Thus, we need to threshold the scores. That is, we need to pick a threshold\n",
    "$t$ such that if the score exceeds $t$, we predict 1, otherwise we predict 0. That is, we have a thresholding function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(v) = \\mathbb{I}(v > t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mathbb{I}(x) = 1$ if $x$ is true and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given the value of $t$, this allows us create two $m_{test}$-dimensional binary vectors. One vector contains the true labels for the test set (call it $\\mathbf{y}$) and the other contains our predicted labels (call it $\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Bad Idea) Accuracy\n",
    "One approach is to simply compute the fraction of times that our prediction matches the true label. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Accuracy = \\frac{1}{m_{test}} \\sum_{i=1}^{m_{test}}{\\mathbb{I}(\\mathbf{y}_i = \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_i)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this a bad idea? To understand, imagine that we have built a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a person has some rare disease (1 = they have the disease, 0 = they do NOT have the disease). In this case, almost ALL of our training examples will be labeled 0 (because the disease is rare). Thus, a very stupid classifier that ALWAYS predicts 0 will achieve an incredibly high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Better Idea) Precision and Recall\n",
    "To get around this problem, we denote four situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True Positive: We predict 1 and the label is 1\n",
    "2. True Negative: We predict 0 and the label is 0\n",
    "3. False Positive: We predict 1 and the label is 0\n",
    "4. False Negative: We predict 0 and the label is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Denote the number of true positive, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in our testing set with $TP$, $TN$, $FP$, and $FN$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define the following two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, going back to our \"predicting rare disease\" example, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision = When the person has the disease, what's the probability that our classifier will indicate so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall = What fraction of people with the disease is our classifier able to detect?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the fraction of people who have the disease is $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 5: What is the Precision and Recall of a classifier that always predicts that people have the disease?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 6: What is the Precision and Recall of a classifier that never predicts that people have the disease?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 7: What is the Precision and Recall of the perfect classifier?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 8: What is the Precision and Recall of a classifier that flips a fair coin and predicts 1 if heads and 0 if tails?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 9: What is the Precision and Recall of a classifier that randomly samples a number from the uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1] and predicts 1 if the sample is $\\leq p$ and 0 otherwise?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Best Idea) F1 Score\n",
    "Precision and Recall are nice, but it would be nice to summarize the performance of the model using just a single number. For this purpose, we have a metric called the F1 score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{Precision \\cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we pick the threshold $t$?\n",
    "We know $t \\in [0, 1]$, so try a thousand different values of $t$ between 0 and 1 and pick the one with the highest F1 score."
